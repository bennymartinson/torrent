This project requires Synapse to interface with the Kinect:

A Microsoft Kinect tracks the motion of my arms and legs, and sends this information to a Python program on my laptop. This program uses this information to compose musical instructions, which are sent to the MIDI-controlled piano.

Torrent attempts to find a new sonic world in the familiar piano, by playing it in a different way. Effects like echos or tremolos are applied to the outgoing notes to create a thick, sometimes almost electronic-sounding texture in a completely analog way.

The piece is composed of three main sections. In the first, the performer controls the music by playing an imaginary piano, and in the second he controls it by conducting. In the third section, the intensity of the music is calculated by the distance between the arms and the legs, and the speed of movement.
